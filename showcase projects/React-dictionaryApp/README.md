# ⛅🌤️ React Weather App

A responsive weather application built with React. It allows users to search for the current weather in any city and displays up-to-date weather details, including temperature, conditions, wind, and humidity, using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## 🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates real-time API data fetching, form handling, and dynamic component rendering in React. It's cleanly designed for both mobile and desktop devices, and serves as a practical example of how to integrate external APIs into a modern React app.

# 📖🔍 React Dictionary App

A sleek and responsive dictionary app built with React. This project allows users to search for word definitions and see related imagery and phonetics in real time, using an external dictionary API.

## 🚀 Overview

This project is part of my front-end portfolio and showcases how to build a multi-component React app with real-time API integration, user input handling, and clean, responsive design. It fetches data from the [Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/) and displays definitions, pronunciation, and example usage—making it a lightweight and elegant reference tool.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- React  
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- Dictionary API  
- Axios

## ✨ Features

- Search for any English word  
- Displays multiple definitions, part of speech, and phonetics  
- Shows example sentences (when available)  
- Includes relevant image thumbnails  
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile

## 🔧 How It Works

1. User types a word in the search field and hits "Search"  
2. React app sends an API request using Axios  
3. Definitions, pronunciation, and images are fetched and displayed dynamically  
4. Modular components manage layout, logic, and styling

> This project demonstrates fundamental React skills like state management, props, useEffect hooks, and working with external APIs.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
