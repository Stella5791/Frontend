# 🌍⏰ JS World Clock

A sleek and responsive world clock application built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project displays the current time in multiple cities across the globe and allows users to select additional cities from a dropdown menu.

## 🚀 Overview

This project is part of my front-end portfolio and demonstrates real-time updates, dynamic content rendering, and time zone handling using the [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/) JavaScript library. The design is minimal and user-friendly, making it easy to check the time around the world at a glance.
