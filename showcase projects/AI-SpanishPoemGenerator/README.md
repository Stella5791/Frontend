# 🧠📝 AI Spanish Poem Generator

A creative front-end project that simulates an AI generating short Spanish poems based on user input. This interactive app invites users to enter a theme, and then returns a randomly selected mock poem in Spanish. It’s a playful demonstration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in action.

## 🚀 Overview

This project is part of my front-end development portfolio, focusing on creative user interaction and multilingual content. While there’s no real AI involved (yet!), the experience mimics what an AI poetry assistant might look like. The interface is clean, the interaction is smooth, and it’s a fun way to show off DOM manipulation skills.
