# 🧠🍳 AI Recipe Generator

A simple and interactive front-end project that simulates an AI-powered recipe generator. Users can input ingredients they have on hand, and the page displays a "generated" recipe in response. This project showcases basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript interactivity and layout.

## 🚀 Overview

This fun little project is part of my front-end development portfolio. It mimics how an AI might help with cooking inspiration based on user input. While it doesn't connect to a real AI or API yet, it's a great demonstration of DOM manipulation, form handling, and a user-friendly interface.
