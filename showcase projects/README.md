# 🌟 Front-End Showcase Projects

Welcome to my collection of front-end projects! Each project in this folder demonstrates a different skillset in modern web development—from working with APIs and building dynamic UIs in React to crafting responsive layouts with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

These projects were built as part of my learning journey and showcase my growth in front-end development. Most include live demos and are mobile-responsive.
