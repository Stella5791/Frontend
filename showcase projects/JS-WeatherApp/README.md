# 🌦️ JS Weather App

A responsive weather application built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This app allows users to search for current weather conditions in any city worldwide. It fetches real-time data using the OpenWeatherMap API and presents it in a clean, user-friendly interface.

## 🚀 Overview

This project is part of my front-end development portfolio and demonstrates my ability to work with APIs, manipulate the DOM, and style a responsive layout. Users can search for any city and receive up-to-date weather information such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
